# Python_Projects
In this repository, you will find various projects I worked with in Data Science and Machine Learning Operations

-------

## Pandas Development 

In these folders, there are two projects I worked on data analysis:
* Finance Project : In this project, there is python (pandas) program, that takes data from the internet of major banks. Furthermore, an EDA is made on the data.
* 911 Project : In this project, we gathered data from 911 calls. Additionaly, analysis on the data was made.


## Machine Learning Projects

In these folders, the major machine learning algorithms are presented:

* Decision Trees and Random Forests: A program about a lending club was made utilizing the algorithm.
* K-Nearest Neighbour:A simple program, to present the functionalities of KNN algorithm, using artificial data.
* Linear Regression: A program of an ecommerce company that decides the preferability of each users on the in-store purchases versus online marketplace.
* Logistic Regression: A program that shows fake internet advertisement data, whether the ads are clicked or not.
* Support Vector Machines: Utilizing the famous Iris dataset, we make a classification of the flowers with SVM.
* K- Means Clustering: Using K-Means clustering, we further divide a college dataset into Private or Public.


## Natural Language Processing Project

Utilizing the Yelp Review Dataset from Kaggle, we attempt to analyze and classify the data.

## Deep Learning with Tensorflow

In this section, using the Bank Authentication Data from UCI, we implement Neural Nets to set our Bank Authentication System for bank notes. Lastly, we compare the model with Random Forests.
